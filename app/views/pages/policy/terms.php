                        new
                        service, change how
                        we provide a service, or have to comply with a new legal requirement).

                    <p>Our content often includes other people’s content, you
                        see. For instance, a TV show might feature images,

                        show, and it’s the production company who owns it.
                        So you’ll have to ask them if you can use it. Except

                        Sometimes uploading a creation to our services means
                        using a tool provided by someone other than the Buzz.
                        For example you can use WhatsApp to share your
                        stories and eyewitness accounts with Buzz Vibez News.

                        Sometimes the provider’s terms and conditions apply to
                        using their tool. Do read their terms (which you can
                        search for online) as they tell you what the provider can
